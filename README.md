## Description

The Password Generator (mini project #3) focused on creating a password generator involving a specific set of characters (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, special characters). Users were allowed to select the length of their password (8-128 characters), and then the password was randomly generated based upon the character selections and requested password length.

## Challenges

This was a tough challenge. The first thing I did was create the arrays of all of the different characters that could possibly be involved in the password, and set the window confirm and prompt to get the process started. 

Creating the windows (including the variable selection window prompts) was simple enough, but collecting the selections into an array (using push and spread operators) took some thought, as did figuring out what to do with the selected data once it was all together. The concept of the for loop was confusing to me at first (a little too abstract to wrap my brain around), but by the time I got to that step, it made a little more sense. 

Ultimately, I am glad for the challenges that came with this project, since it forced me to view JavaScript on a micro level, something I had been struggling with in class.
